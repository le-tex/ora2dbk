HTMLBook → DocBook 4.5 conversion and postprocessing of asciidoc’s DocBook conversion output.

We’re not doing this because we’re die-hard DocBook proponents. It’s for German typesetters who receive translations of Atlas books written in HTMLBook and asciidoc. Until these kinds of books are also produced in Atlas, they’re still sent to typesetters who have existing layouts & workflows based on DocBook 4.5.
