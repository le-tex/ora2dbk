<h3>Atlas Conversion to DocBook 4.5</h3>
<p>You may upload either single HTML files or a Zip file that contains
 JSON and HTML files on its top level (no directories in the Zip!).</p>
<p>The JSON should contain a list called <code>files</code>, like this:</p>
<pre>{
  "branch": "master",
  "files": [
    "cover.html",
    "titlepage.html",
    "copyright.html",
    "toc.html",
    "ch01.html",
    "ix.html",
    "author_bio.html"
  ],
  …
</pre>
<p>The HTML files need only contain body content. The top-level element
may be <code>section</code>, for example. It may be any kind of HTML 
(XHTML, HTML5, …).</p>
<p>The files will be read in order and then converted to a single DocBook 4.5 file
that will then be split into individual files that correspond to the input files.
There will be a container DocBook file that includes the individual files by 
means of XInclude instructions.</p>
